## Purpose

Explain what decision this document captures and why it exists.

## Context

Describe the problem, constraints, forces, and existing conditions that shape the decision.

## Decision

Describe the chosen approach clearly enough that planning can proceed from it.

## Alternatives Considered

List the meaningful alternatives and why they were not chosen.

## Consequences

Describe outcomes, trade-offs, risks, and follow-on implications.

## Intended Follow-On

- Route: `baseline-plan` or `change-plan`
- Next Prompt: [{{PROMPT_LABEL}}](../prompts/{{PROMPT_FILE}})
- Why: Explain why this design should flow into that planning path.
- Coordinate Handoff: For `change-plan`, identify the related completed coordinate and recommended downstream W/R coordinate when known; otherwise state `unresolved; planner must resolve before writing.`
