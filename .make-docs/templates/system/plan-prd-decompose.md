# Codebase Decomposition Plan

> In v2, plans are directories. Use this template as the shape of the `00-overview.md` file in the plan directory; split additional detail into `0N-<phase>.md` files as needed.

**Date:** {{DATE}}

**Repository:** `{{REPO_ROOT}}`

**Purpose:** Produce a reviewable plan for reverse-engineering the repository into a structured PRD set and rebuild backlog.

## Objective

State what the decomposition should preserve, who the outputs are for, and what counts as completion.

## Coordinate Decision

- Coordinate: `W{{W}} R{{R}}`
- Classification: `new-wave` or `revision`
- Evidence: Explain the explicit user guidance, design handoff, source lineage, prior plan/work/history records, or highest-wave fallback used to choose this coordinate.

## Output Contract

- Plan directory: `docs/plans/{{DATE}}-w{{W}}-r{{R}}-{{SLUG}}/`
  - entry point: `docs/plans/{{DATE}}-w{{W}}-r{{R}}-{{SLUG}}/00-overview.md`
  - phase files: `docs/plans/{{DATE}}-w{{W}}-r{{R}}-{{SLUG}}/0N-<phase>.md`
- PRD core:
  - `docs/prd/00-index.md`
  - `docs/prd/01-product-overview.md`
  - `docs/prd/02-architecture-overview.md`
  - `docs/prd/03-open-questions-and-risk-register.md`
  - `docs/prd/04-glossary.md`
  - adaptive numbered subsystem/reference docs starting at `05-*`
- Rebuild work:
  - `docs/work/{{DATE}}-w{{W}}-r{{R}}-{{SLUG}}/`

## Existing PRD Handling

- Active `docs/prd/` status: {{ACTIVE_PRD_STATUS}}
- Archive step required before execution: {{ARCHIVE_REQUIRED}}
- Planned archive target if approved: `{{ARCHIVE_TARGET}}`
- Active root entries to archive: {{ARCHIVE_ENTRIES}}

## Coordinator Policy

- Highest intended delegation tier: {{DELEGATION_TIER}}
- Coordinator role: `coordination only`
- Coordinator write scope: `none` when delegation is available
- Coordinator responsibilities: preflight, approvals, routing, worker spawning, progress tracking, blocker handling, final status reporting

## Proposed Catalog

List the fixed core docs plus adaptive docs and explain whether the tree should stay flat or use numbered subfolders.

## Worker Ownership

List the delegated workers, their scopes, write scopes, dependencies, and deliverables.

- Assign every output-writing task to a worker when delegation is available.
- Include a dedicated shared-doc assembly worker for `docs/prd/00-index.md`, `docs/prd/03-open-questions-and-risk-register.md`, `docs/prd/04-glossary.md`, and the rebuild backlog.
- Include a dedicated validation/fix worker when the harness can support it.
- The coordinator should not appear as the owner of any document-writing task when delegation is available.

## MCP Strategy

- Preferred servers available: {{MCP_STATUS}}
- Fallback plan if unavailable: {{FALLBACK_PLAN}}

## Validation

Explain how the execution step will validate the generated outputs and which review pass happens at the end.
