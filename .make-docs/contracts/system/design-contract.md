# Design Contract

## Purpose

Use this contract for agent-generated design docs under `docs/designs/`.

User-authored design docs may not fully conform. Apply this contract to newly generated design docs and to substantial agent-authored updates.

## Required Path

- `docs/designs/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`

`YYYY-MM-DD` is today's date (never backdated). `<slug>` is lowercase, hyphens only.

## Archiving

Archive designs only when the user explicitly asks. Never archive proactively.

Defer to `docs/assets/archive/AGENTS.md` for archive structure and procedure.

## Required Headings

Generated design docs must include:

- `## Purpose`
- `## Context`
- `## Decision`
- `## Alternatives Considered`
- `## Consequences`
- `## Intended Follow-On`

## Intended Follow-On Contract

The `## Intended Follow-On` section must include:

- `Route:` `baseline-plan` or `change-plan`
- `Next Prompt:` a relative Markdown link to the matching prompt template
- `Why:` a short explanation of why that route is the correct downstream workflow
- `Coordinate Handoff:` when known, a short note that names the related completed coordinate and the recommended downstream W/R coordinate

Required prompt targets:

- `baseline-plan` → `[designs-to-plan.prompt.md](../prompts/designs-to-plan.prompt.md)`
- `change-plan` → `[designs-to-plan-change.prompt.md](../prompts/designs-to-plan-change.prompt.md)`

For `change-plan` designs, include `Coordinate Handoff` whenever the design revises, reworks, corrects, standardizes, or finishes earlier wave work. The handoff should identify the prior coordinate, the recommended downstream coordinate, and the basis for treating the work as a revision rather than a new wave. If the coordinate cannot be resolved from the request or repository history, write `Coordinate Handoff: unresolved; planner must resolve before writing.`

## Optional Design Lineage

Add `## Design Lineage` when a generated design materially updates prior design intent or when a new design doc is closely related to an earlier design.

When present, include:

- `Update Mode:` `updated-existing` or `new-doc-related`
- `Prior Design Docs:` relative Markdown links
- `Reason:` a short explanation of the lineage relationship

## Link Rules

- Use relative Markdown links between design docs and related plans, PRD docs, or work items.
- Apply `.make-docs/references/system/path-and-link-hygiene.md` for repo-relative path rules, sanitized placeholders, and full-path exceptions.
- If a design is intended to feed planning, the `Next Prompt` link in `## Intended Follow-On` must resolve.
