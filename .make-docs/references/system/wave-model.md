# Wave Model

## Purpose

This file is the single source of truth for the Wave/Revision/Phase (W/R/P) encoding used across `make-docs` v2.

Every other reference file, template, and router links here instead of restating these rules. The encoding was piloted in `.make-docs/contracts/system/history-record-contract.md` and is extended to designs, plans, and work in v2. PRDs are exempt; see `## PRD Exemption`.

## Terms

| Token | Name | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `w{W}` | Wave | One end-to-end iteration: design to plan to work. Wave 1 is the initial wave. A new wave begins when the user starts a new end-to-end initiative. |
| `r{R}` | Revision | Revision within a wave. `r0` is the initial revision. `r1+` are meaningful redos of that wave's artifacts (for example a redesigned design or a re-planned plan after feedback). |
| `p{P}` | Phase | Phase within a plan or work backlog. Appears in inner phase files, phase-scoped history filenames, and history record `coordinate` frontmatter. `p{P}` does not appear in the top-level names of designs, plans, or work directories. Stage/task detail stays in `coordinate` only. |
| `t{T}` | Task | Task within one work backlog phase file. Task IDs appear on `### Tasks` checkbox items as phase-local ordinals (`t1`, `t2`, etc.) and are referenced externally as `w{W} r{R} p{P} t{T}` by inferring W/R from the work directory and P from the phase file. |

## Naming Patterns

| Artifact | Required path |
| --- | --- |
| Plan directory | `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-w{W}-r{R}-<slug>/` |
| Plan overview file | `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-w{W}-r{R}-<slug>/00-overview.md` |
| Plan phase file | `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-w{W}-r{R}-<slug>/0N-<phase>.md` |
| Work directory | `docs/work/YYYY-MM-DD-w{W}-r{R}-<slug>/` |
| Work index file | `docs/work/YYYY-MM-DD-w{W}-r{R}-<slug>/00-index.md` |
| Work phase file | `docs/work/YYYY-MM-DD-w{W}-r{R}-<slug>/0N-<phase>.md` |
| Breadcrumb record | `docs/assets/archive/history/YYYY-MM-DD-w{W}-r{R}-p{P}-<slug>.md` when W/R/P is known; see `.make-docs/contracts/system/history-record-contract.md` for fallbacks. |

`YYYY-MM-DD` is the date the artifact is written. Never backdate.

`<slug>` is lowercase, hyphens only, no special characters.

## Resolution Rules

When writing a new plan directory or work directory, determine `W` and `R` in this order:

1. **Honor explicit guidance.** If the user has stated the wave or revision (for example "this is wave 2" or "redo the design as r1"), use those values.
2. **Resolve source lineage before scanning for the highest wave.** Inspect the user request, referenced designs, design lineage, intended follow-on coordinate handoff, prior plans, prior work backlogs, and history records for an existing W/R/P coordinate. If the new work revises, reworks, corrects, standardizes, or finishes something already delivered in a known wave, keep that `W` and use the next unused `R` for that wave. This lineage rule wins even when later unrelated waves already exist.
3. **Scan the target directory only after lineage is resolved** (`docs/plans/` or `docs/work/`) for existing entries matching `w{W}-r{R}`. Parse the highest `W` and the existing revisions for any lineage-selected wave.
4. **Decide W and R when no source lineage applies:**
   - If the user is revising an existing artifact in the highest relevant wave, keep `W` and use the next unused `R`.
   - If the user is starting a new end-to-end initiative, increment the highest existing `W` and reset `R` to `0`.
5. **If no prior entries exist**, default to `w1-r0`.

Do not assign a new wave solely because newer unrelated waves exist. The highest-wave scan is a fallback for genuinely new initiatives, not evidence that a revision to older work belongs to a newer wave.

For breadcrumb records, store any known W/R/P/S/T position in the `coordinate` frontmatter field described by `.make-docs/contracts/system/history-record-contract.md`. Include W/R/P in the filename when all three are known. Include W/R when only those two are known. Keep stage and task detail only in `coordinate`.

For work backlog tasks, number task IDs ordinally across the entire phase file, not within each stage. Start the first task at `t1`, continue through later `### Tasks` sections without resetting, and do not renumber existing task IDs when inserting or completing work. Use unordered markdown task syntax (`- [ ] t1: ...` or `- [x] t1: ...`) so checkbox rendering stays reliable.

## PRD Exemption

PRDs are intentionally exempt from W/R/P. The PRD namespace is maintained in place as the current product authority rather than iterating in waves.

- PRD docs keep the fixed `NN-<slug>.md` convention described in `.make-docs/contracts/system/output-contract.md`.
- PRD filenames, H1 titles, kinds, and document-level frontmatter describe product subjects, not maintenance operations or revision coordinates.
- W/R/P coordinates may appear in a PRD's source links or non-normative `## Requirement History` entries to identify the maintenance event; they are not PRD document identity.
- Authoritative maintenance for PRDs is governed by `.make-docs/references/system/prd-change-management.md`.
- Archived PRD sets are grouped by date, not by wave (see `## Archive Integration`).

## Design Exemption

Designs are exempt from W/R encoding. Design filenames use the simplified pattern `YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`.

The date provides chronological ordering; the slug provides topical identity. No wave or revision identifier is required.

When a design is revised or superseded, write a new dated design and use `## Design Lineage` (defined in `.make-docs/contracts/system/design-contract.md`) to link back to prior designs. Do not use `r{R}` revision numbering on designs.

Designs are inputs to a wave cycle (design → plan → work), not products of one. Binding a design to a wave number implies a 1:1 relationship with a downstream plan/work cycle that often does not hold.

## Archive Integration

Archive rules for designs, plans, work, and PRDs live in `docs/assets/archive/AGENTS.md`. W/R/P naming is preserved when an artifact is archived; it is not rewritten.

## Forward Compatibility

The W/R/P encoding was piloted in legacy history filenames before broader adoption. Existing legacy files continue to conform without change.
